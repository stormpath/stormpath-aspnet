# Stormpath Middleware for ASP.NET
This library makes it incredibly simple to add user authentication features to your application, such as login, signup, authorization, and social login.

[Stormpath](https://stormpath.com) is a User Management API that reduces development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Stormpath's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage and secure users and roles in any application.

:bulb: If you're using ASP.NET Core 1.0, grab our [ASP.NET Core library](https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-aspnetcore) instead.
